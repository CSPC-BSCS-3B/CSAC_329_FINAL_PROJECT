## Introduction

This project is an interactive educational application designed to demonstrate various cryptographic algorithms and techniques. It provides a hands-on environment where users can experiment with different encryption methods, hash functions, and digital signatures in real-time.

In today's digital age, cryptography plays a crucial role in securing information and communications. From protecting personal messages to securing financial transactions, cryptographic algorithms are the backbone of digital security. This application aims to demystify these complex algorithms by providing an intuitive interface for users to explore and understand how they work.

The importance of cryptography extends beyond just technical applications. It's a fundamental component of privacy, trust, and security in our increasingly connected world. By creating an interactive platform to explore these concepts, this project serves both as an educational tool and a practical demonstration of cryptographic principles.

- **Backend**: Python 3.8+ for all cryptographic operations and business logic
- **Cryptographic Libraries**: 
  - **PyCryptodome**: For symmetric encryption algorithms and some hash functions
  - **Cryptography**: For asymmetric encryption and modern cryptographic primitives
  - **Hashlib**: Python's built-in library for hash functions

### Application Structure

The application follows a modular design with the following components:

## Cryptographic Algorithms Implementation

### Symmetric Encryption Algorithms

#### AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- **Type**: Symmetric Block Cipher
- **Background**: Developed by Belgian cryptographers Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, AES was selected by NIST in 2001 to replace DES as the standard encryption algorithm for the US government. It has since become the worldwide standard for secure communications.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Uses a substitution-permutation network with a fixed block size of 128 bits
  - Supports 128-bit key size (can be extended to 192/256 bits)
  - Uses CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode with a random initialization vector (IV)
  - Employs PKCS#7 padding for blocks
  - Provides full support for both text and file encryption/decryption
  - Includes performance metrics for operation timing
- **Security Strength**: Very strong, no practical attacks against the full algorithm
- **Use Cases**: Secure communications, file encryption, password protection

#### DES (Data Encryption Standard)
- **Type**: Symmetric Block Cipher
- **Background**: Developed in the early 1970s at IBM and adopted as a federal standard in 1977. While historically significant, it is now considered insecure due to its small key size.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - 56-bit effective key (64-bit key with 8 parity bits)
  - 64-bit block size using Feistel network structure
  - CBC mode implementation with proper IV handling
  - Includes security warnings about its vulnerabilities
  - Supports both text and file operations for educational purposes
- **Security Strength**: Weak by modern standards (brute force feasible)
- **Use Cases**: Legacy systems, educational purposes only (not recommended for secure applications)

#### 3DES (Triple DES)
- **Type**: Symmetric Block Cipher
- **Background**: Developed as a way to extend the lifespan of DES by applying the algorithm three times in sequence with different keys. It was widely used as a transitional algorithm between DES and AES.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - 168-bit effective key (192-bit with parity bits)
  - Applies DES three times using encrypt-decrypt-encrypt sequence
  - Uses the same CBC mode and padding scheme as our other implementations
  - Includes performance comparisons with AES to demonstrate its relative inefficiency
  - Supports text and file operations with detailed feedback
- **Security Strength**: Moderate (secure against most attacks but slow)
- **Use Cases**: Legacy financial systems, backward compatibility

### Asymmetric Encryption Algorithms

#### RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)
- **Type**: Asymmetric Encryption
- **Background**: Developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, RSA was one of the first practical public-key cryptosystems. It revolutionized secure communications by allowing secure key exchange without a pre-shared secret.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Supports 2048 and 4096-bit key options
  - Full key pair generation functionality
  - PEM format key export and import
  - Handles encryption size limitations using appropriate padding
  - Implements OAEP padding for security
  - Provides clear separation of public and private key operations
- **Security Strength**: Strong with proper key sizes (2048+ bits)
- **Use Cases**: Secure key exchange, digital signatures, certificate-based authentication

#### ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)
- **Type**: Asymmetric Encryption/Signing
- **Background**: Developed independently by Neal Koblitz and Victor Miller in the mid-1980s, ECC has gained popularity due to its ability to provide equivalent security to RSA with much smaller key sizes.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Implements SECP256R1, SECP384R1, and SECP521R1 curves
  - Focuses on digital signature functionality
  - Provides efficient key generation and management
  - Includes visual representations of signature verification
  - Demonstrates smaller key sizes compared to RSA
- **Security Strength**: Very strong with smaller keys than equivalent RSA
- **Use Cases**: Resource-constrained environments, mobile applications, IoT devices

#### DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)
- **Type**: Asymmetric Signing
- **Background**: Developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and published as a standard in 1994. It was specifically designed for digital signatures rather than encryption.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Supports 1024, 2048, and 3072-bit key options
  - Implements signature generation and verification
  - Focuses on document signing use cases
  - Provides timing metrics for performance analysis
  - Includes educational comparisons with RSA and ECC signatures
- **Security Strength**: Strong with proper key sizes
- **Use Cases**: Document signing, code signing, non-repudiation services

### Hashing Functions

#### Implemented Hash Algorithms
- **MD5** (128-bit): Considered cryptographically broken, included for educational comparison
- **SHA-1** (160-bit): Deprecated but included for legacy comparison
- **SHA-256** (256-bit): Currently widely used for most applications
- **SHA-512** (512-bit): Higher security variant for sensitive applications
- **BLAKE2** (256-bit): Modern, high-performance hash function
- **SHA3-256** (256-bit): Latest NIST standard hash function

#### Implementation Details
